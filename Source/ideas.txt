============================================================================

warriors:
- earthquake (aoe w slash animation)
- stampede (attack run through ppl that does damage)
- slash (projectile from weapon)

robur does nothing

spear attacks are not correct

magic damage buff-type is not used

can't see props of own items in trade window

geonan head has a seam that needs fixing

casting spell anim should not affect legs (or should make them idle)

add todo() and confirm() **everywhere** for stability

IDEA : PORTAL SCROLLS THAT TAKE YOU TO A RANDOM PLACE!!!

casting monsters need to run up and attack between casts

make dragon guardians able to fly over pit

when wading, you don't move to where you click.

swimming idle -> animation?

wading animations are not used (they are just walking anims)
